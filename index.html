			<p>Hi, my name is Damian Sopel and I am a 23 year old UW-Madison graduate (Go Badgers!) currently living in River Grove, IL. Though my original field of study was Statistics, I've found more enjoyment in the creative process of 
			web development and the puzzle-solving challenges that it provides. </p>
			<p>A year after graduation, I enrolled in Thinkful's Front End Web Development program before transitioning into their Flexible Full Stack Bootcamp. During my time with the program, I was exposed to a wide variety of languages and frameworks starting with basic front end languages like HTML, CSS, and jQuery before moving on to back end frameworks and libraries such as Node, Mongoose, and Express. By the end, I was able to create a complex CRUD MERN
			stack application which can be seen under "School Management App" in my main portfolio page. </p>
			<p>Having completed Thinkful's Full Stack Bootcamp, my attention now turns to seeking my first job as a web developer. My greatest strengths are a strong work ethic, willingness to learn new information, and strong attention to detail. If you have any questions or would like to get in touch, please don't hesitate to contact me at (312)-513-4187 or using the information located under the "Contact" tab.
